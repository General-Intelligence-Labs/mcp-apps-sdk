name: Publish Packages

# This workflow automatically publishes packages to npm using Changesets and Trusted Publishing (OIDC).
#
# How to trigger a release:
#
# 1. Make your code changes
# 2. Run: pnpm changeset
#    - Select which packages changed
#    - Choose version bump type (major/minor/patch)
#    - Write a description of changes
# 3. Commit the changeset file: git add .changeset/ && git commit -m "chore: add changeset"
# 4. Push to main: git push
# 5. This workflow will create a "Version Packages" PR
# 6. Review and merge the PR
# 7. This workflow will automatically publish to npm!
#
# Requirements:
# - Trusted Publishing must be configured on npm for each package
# - Go to https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xalia/PACKAGE_NAME/access
# - Add trusted publisher: general-intelligence-labs/mcp-apps-sdk, workflow: publish.yml
